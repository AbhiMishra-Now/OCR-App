<ul>
  <li> The app allows users to take a picture of a document, receipt, or any text-containing image, and then crop the image using the Image Cropper library. The app then uses OCR technology to extract the text from the cropped image, and displays it in the app. Users can then copy the extracted text to the clipboard, which can be pasted into any text-editing application.  </li>
  <br>
  <li> The app is developed in Java using Android Studio, and it utilizes the Google Mobile Vision OCR library to perform the OCR. The Image Cropper library is used to enable users to crop the image before OCR processing. The app is designed to be user-friendly, with an intuitive user interface that allows users to easily take pictures, crop images, and copy text to the clipboard.</li>   </li>
